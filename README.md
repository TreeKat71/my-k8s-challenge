# DigitalOcean Kubernetes Challenge - CICD pipeline with GitOps

- [x] Setup k8s manually with `kudeadm`
- [ ] Setup `Harbor`
- [x] Setup CI pipeline with `Github Actions`
- [ ] Setup CD pipeline with `ArgoCD`
- [x] Commit sample `fastapi` code
- [ ] Upgrade k8s version

Would like to try `fluentd` and `kube-monkey` if I have time.
