# DigitalOcean Kubernetes Challenge - CICD pipeline with GitOps

1. Setup k8s manually with `kudeadm`
2. Setup `Harbor`
3. Setup CI pipeline with `Github Actions`
4. Setup CD pipeline with `ArgoCD`
5. Commit sample `fastapi` code
6. Upgrade k8s version

Would like to try `fluentd` and `kube-monkey` if I have time.
